# COMET
Mapping multimodal associations between (functional) COnnectivity - (cerebral glucose) METabolism

COMET.m is a MATLAB script for calculating rPWR and rCST. It requires two 4D maps (e.g., PET-based metabolic maps for all participants and the correponding fMRI-based activity maps) and one 3D map (for masking the data). You may alter the script to accommodate your data. Please note that the following (free) toolbox is required for reading the NIFTI maps (which should be downloaded and present in the same director as 'COMET.m'):
